#Exercise: Take the following Python code that stores a string:â€˜str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
#Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character
#and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'

moral_str = str.split(':')[1]

result = float(moral_str)

print(result)
